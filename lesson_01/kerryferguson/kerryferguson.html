<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Kerry Ferguson is a recent graduate from the University of Delaware with a BA in Computer Science. He hopes to gain more experience, get a good job, and continue doing what he loves while supporting his loved ones.</p>
<h2>Work Hours</h2>
<p>I work on a 9-5 schedule on weekdays. I'm a night owl, so I do my work later in the day on weekends. </p>
<h2>Likes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coffee. Give me some creamer and sugar and I'm good to go for a couple hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music. I'm not picky with genres, as long as I'm not working in complete silence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Space. Unless needed by someone, I prefer to stay in my own bubble when working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chocolate. The cravings must be satiated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of my more general interests (I'm always available to talk about hobbies!):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawing </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dislikes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of structure. I like to be organized, and a lack of structure causes a drop of quality in my work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sudden changes of plans (without good reason)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting talked over/interrupted in conversations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I learn?</h2>
<p>I'm mainly a visual learner. I like to quietly observe while taking mental (and physical) notes. I'm not the most talkative person, but I am still actively engaged and participating when learning and conversing with others. I also enjoy helping others, which reinforces what I've learned.</p>
<h2>How do I like to give feedback?</h2>
<p>When it comes to giving feedback, I prefer to have a conversation (in person or virtual) while writing notes. This ensures that everything is understood properly, and that the feedback can be reviewed at a later time. </p>
<h2>How do I like to receive feedback?</h2>
<p>When it comes to receiving feedback, I prefer the same methods as when I am giving feedback to someone. I would prefer to be emailed notes rather than using Google Chat. </p>
<h2>Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with me?</h2>
<p>If we can't talk in person, then Google Chat or email is fine! Having headphones in is usually a sign that I'm hard at work, but I don't mind being interrupted to talk!</p>
<h2>Goal for the coming year:</h2>
<p>I want to become more proficient in how I think about coding. I want to increase my proficiency at writing code as well. </p>
<h2>Fun facts:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My birthday: 03/15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My hometown: New Castle, DE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favorite Color: Green</p>
</li>
